# React-Authors-application

This is a school project that I built using React.js, Mui Library and next.js. That displays authors and all their books in all languages. I accomplished this by building custom componets and using a library API. This demostrates an understanding of using hooks like useEffect and useState, aswell as fetch requests and componet building.
